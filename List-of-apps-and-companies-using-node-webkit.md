**Does your favorite mock-up tool output production-ready code?**
Of course not, that would take way too much time / effort! That's why we make mockups, so we can iterate quickly...

JazzUI makes it easier to get into the flexibility and precision of HTML/CSS while maintaining the quick iterative features of a traditional mockup tool. Plus more awesome. **And 100% Open Source**.
