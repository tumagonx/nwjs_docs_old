Hi all,

In v0.3.2, there're two major changes, one is the fix of message loop integration on Mac, which should have solved performance problem for cases that need heavy data transfer in node. The other one is the ability to handle files and arguments[1], which would be necessary for apps like IDEs and text editors.
