You will need a `.icns` file, size `1024x1024`. 

If you're not sure where to start, begin by creating a 1024x1024 `.png` file, you can convert it with a tool like [png2icns](https://github.com/daveish/png2icns).

Once your icon is ready, move it to `YourApp.app/Contents/Resources/nw.icns`, by overriding the existing one.
