* nw-gyp is supported from version 0.3.2 *

nw-gyp is a hack on node-gyp to support node-webkit specific headers and libraries. 

The usage is the same with node-gyp, except that you need to specify the version of node-webkit manually. Please see https://github.com/rogerwang/nw-gyp for more details.
