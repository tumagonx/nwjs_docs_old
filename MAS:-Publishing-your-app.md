## First version

Once your package has been uploaded and selected, you still have to fill all the remaining fields.

Before being able to submit your first version, you will also have to select the release date, and the price.

Prices are based on *levels*, that define a price for every country where the app is available.

## Other versions

When publishing a new version, you only have to update the description field, and the build.

(Other fields can also be updated, if needed.)

You can also choose if you want a manual or auto release (when choosing *auto*, the version will be published automatically on the MAS when validated.)
