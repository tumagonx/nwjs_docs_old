What doesn't work on your side?

# Audio
Audio should work. The problem should be the codec for mp3 or other non-free media formats. See [[Support mp3 and H264 in video and audio tag]]

# WebGL
2 extra DLL files from DirectX are needed, or your GFX card/driver is on Chromium's black list. See https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/issues/185
