## Preparing extra files

The following sub-directories can be put in application's root directory:

* **node_modules** - any Node modules you want to deploy with your application
* **plugins** - NPAPI plugin files

You don't need to ship the `nwsnapshot` file in the downloaded zip.

## Make a package

_Since our package system is similar to [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org), following guides are modified from its [Wiki](https://love2d.org/wiki/Game_Distribution)._

An app's package is a zip archive with `.nw` as extension. Three caveats:

* There must be a `package.json` file that describes the package, see [[Manifest format]].
* The `package.json` file must be at the root of the archive. 
* In the `.nw`, the file and directory path names are case sensitive. This can be puzzling for Windows and Mac OS X users, whose filesystem is case insensitive, and whose apps may work when unzipped but not when packaged.

Here's how to proceed to generate a working `.nw` file:

### Windows 

1. Create a zip file (this is built into XP, Vista and 7) 
2. Copy all of your files into the zip file, retaining directory structure and making sure that the `package.json` file is in the root directory (if you make a zip file containing a folder with your stuff in it, then it's not going to work) 
3. Rename the file extension from `.zip` to `.nw`. By default, file extensions may be hidden. You need to (press `alt`), go to folder options and uncheck "Hide extensions for known file types" to be able to rename the zip. 

### Linux / OS X 

From the command line: 

1. Go to your project directory a la `cd ~/Projects/my_app`
2. Run `zip -r ../${PWD##*/}.nw *`
3. Your fully-prepared `.nw` file shall be located right outside of your project directory 
4. Cake!

## Making an executable file out of a .nw file 

Many people are (understandably) concerned about what end-users need to do in order to run an app. If users receive a `.nw` alone, they will naturally need `node-webkit` installed (or at least unzipped) in order to run it. But, with `node-webkit`, you can merge the `.nw` file with the `node-webkit` executable. 

In general, it's recommended to offer a `.nw` for download, and optionally "merged" versions for the platforms where this makes things simpler. 

Two things should be noted: 

* The end result will not be a single executable, you must also include some DLLs in your zip-file. 
* The resulting executable from the merge will still be readable by archiving software, such as WinZip.

### Windows 

Here's how to do it on Windows. In a console, type this: 

    copy /b nw.exe+app.nw app.exe 

Then, all you have to do is zip app.exe and required DLLs, and distribute them. Yes; this does mean that the game will have a private copy of `node-webkit`, but there's nothing wrong with that. It also means that you will have to create one package for each platform you would like to support, or simply offer the `.nw` alone for the other platforms. 

And please also note that the `nw.pak` must also be distributed along with the `app.exe`.

### Linux 

On Linux, it's similar: 

    cat /usr/bin/nw app.nw > app && chmod +x app 

Then, you'll have to make a package for various packaging systems with dependencies as the `node-webkit` package. Were you to make a .deb package this way, for instance, the user would not have to install the `node-webkit` package separately. 

And please note that the `nw.pak` file must also be in the same directory with the `app` file, otherwise you would expect blank page for some features.

Eventually, we will provide scripts which do this automatically for various package systems. You'll have to figure it out yourself until then. 

### Mac OS X 

_Following guides apply to node-webkit >= 0.2.4_

On OS X, the `node-webkit.app` is a directory that can be easily changed. To make node-webkit automatically open your app, you need to put your app file under `Contents/Resources` and name it `app.nw`. The bonus over other platforms is, the `app.nw` needs not to be a zip file, if you want to speed up startup, you can make `app.nw` your app's directory.

And you need to modify following files to make a real distribution of yours:

* `Contents/Resources/app.icns`: icon of your app.
* `Contents/Info.plist`: the apple package description file.

About the `Info.plist` file, you can view [Implementing Cocoa's Standard About Panel](http://cocoadevcentral.com/articles/000071.php) on how this file will influence your app and what fields you should modify.

## Which files should be shipped?

Apart from the binary files, there're some other files you should also ship, see instructions for different platforms bellow

### Windows

The `nw.pak` and `icudt.dll` must be shipped along with `nw.exe`, the former one contains important javascript lib files, and the latter one is a important network library.

`ffmpegsumo.dll` are media library, if you want to use `<video>` and `<audio>` tag, or other media related features, you should ship it.

`libEGL.dll` and `libGLESv2.dll` are used for WebGL and GPU acceleration, you had better ship them. And `D3DCompiler_43.dll` and `d3dx9_43.dll` as well if you want to make sure WebGL works on more hardware. These 2 files are from DirectX redistributable.

### Linux

`nw.pak` must be shipped with `nw`. If you want media features, also ship `libffmpeg.so`.

### Mac OS X

Just ship the `node-webkit.app` would be fine, you don't need to care for other things.
